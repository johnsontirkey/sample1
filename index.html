                    It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, 
                    it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
                    it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, 
                    it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, 
                    it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.

                    I took the one less traveled by,
                    And that has made all the difference.

                    The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, 
                    mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, 
                    the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, 
                    burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.

                    I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that 
                    brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass 
                    over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner 
                    eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. 
                    Only I will remain.
